{% img left /images/RuiMarques.jpg Rui Marques %} Hi, my name is Rui Marques. I'm a .NET programmer, lead programmer and a sort of self made some sort of sysadmin (mainly Windows Server with some linux skills). Currently I work as lead programmer at Flesk Telecom, a top hosting company in Portugal that owns it's own datacenter. I'm also a Parallels Certified Automation Professional both for Linux and Windows.

I consider myself as a pragmatic programmer that continuously searches to follow and learn about best practices/work patterns (like agile/scrum) and capable to adopt and implement (or improving existing) strategies/methodologies combining the best tools (bug/issue tracking, scm, wiki, etc) necessary to develop solutions with quality in mind.

My key skills includes all the major technologies involved in developing software based, in particular web applications, on the .NET Framework (C#, ASP.NET, XML, XSLT, xHTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, Sql Server, MySQL, sqlite3, web services, etc). Also developing some projects based on Windows Forms, console and Windows Services make my day.

I've been working on IT for since 1999 in particular, after 2005, focused on .NET development.
