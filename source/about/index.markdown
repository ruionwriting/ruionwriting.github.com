{% img left /images/RuiMarques.jpg Rui Marques %} Hi, my name is Rui Marques. I'm a .NET programmer. Currently I work as senior developer at GradWeb, UKâ€™s leading graduate, entry-level and volume
recruitment specialist. I'm also a Parallels Certified Automation Professional both for Linux and Windows.

My key skills includes all the major technologies involved in developing software based, in particular web applications, on the .NET Framework (C#, ASP.NET, XML, XSLT, xHTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, KnockoutJS, Sql Server, sqlite3, SOAP/REST web services, etc).

I consider myself as a pragmatic developer that continuously searches to learn and follow best practices/work patterns (like agile/xp) and capable to adopt and implement (or improving existing) strategies/methodologies combining the best tools (bug/issue tracking, scm, wiki, etc) needed to develop solutions with quality in mind.

My current personal (self-motivation) research topics are: micro ORM's, javascript, html5/KinneticJS, TDD/DDD, database performance tuning, code metrics and re-factoring in favour of performance code-reuse and unit testing (xunit and nunit).

I've been working on IT for since 1999 in particular, after 2005, focused on .NET development.
