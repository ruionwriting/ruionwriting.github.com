{% img left /images/RuiMarques.jpg Rui Marques %} Hi, my name is Rui Marques. I'm a .NET programmer. Currently I work as senior developer at GradWeb, UKâ€™s leading graduate, entry-level and volume
recruitment specialist. I'm also a Parallels Certified Automation Professional both for Linux and Windows.

I've been working on IT for since 1999 in particular, after 2005, focused on .NET development. I consider myself as a full-stack developer.

My key skills includes the major technologies involved in developing software based, in particular web applications, on the .NET Framework (C#, ASP.NET, XML, XSLT, xHTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, KnockoutJS, Sql Server, sqlite3, SOAP/REST web services, ORMs, DI, etc).

I continuously search to learn new technologies and follow best practices/work patterns and capable to adopt and implement (or improving existing) strategies/methodologies combining the best tools and ideas needed to develop solutions with quality in mind.

My current personal (self-motivation) research topics are: micro ORM's, Javascript, HTML5/KinneticJS, TDD/DDD, database performance, code metrics and re-factoring in favour of performance code-reuse and unit testing (xUnit and NUnit).
