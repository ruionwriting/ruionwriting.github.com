Real blogging, like [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) does (and many others), is a serious thing that requires discipline and a personal commitment. I’ve failed to do anything even close *(<1%???)* of what Scott does concerning sharing with the community real stuff that teach and empower any developer skills.<!-- more -->

## I’m a failed blogger
I've a lot of excuses that sum up to NO TIME. What??? The truth is that I didn't really enforce a discipline to blogging and the excuse about not having spare time and patience fitted just perfectly all this time. 3 years after my first blog post I have to try something new: a personal commitment to write something useful and clear with more regularity.

## I want to learn more
Blogging about findings/opinions (personal) related to my job daily challenges, problems and solutions is an opportunity to be a better programmer, person (yes, I work also with people) and ultimately a better professional. 

## Why Octopress?
Why not? I love [git](http://git-scm.com/) and I want to learn new stuff so Octopress seems to be the perfect framework for it. Any Windows/.NET guy with some linux exposure will gain some extra skills in the process (empowers extra curiosity for Windows guts). Octopress it is, exiting confort zone...
